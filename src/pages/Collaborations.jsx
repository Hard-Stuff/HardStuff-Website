					ASquared's six-month remote-first Impact Accelerator is back for round two, supporting 20+ pre-seed
					UK startups with genuine positive impact goals aligned with the UN SDGs.
					<br />
					<br />
					The program offers bespoke mentorship, networking, and a unique chance to pitch for investment from
					ASquared at the Funding Show. Mentors include industry veterans like Dave Allison, VP Engineering at
					OVO, and Kristina Pereckaite, Managing Director of South East Angels.
					<br />
					<br />
					Startups already in the Impact Accelerator cohort benefit from a unique discount with Hard Stuff
					saving up to 20% on the milestone rates for building hardware prototypes and conducting effective
					testing. And if you've worked with Hard Stuff already to build out your first demonstrable prototype
					then get a Â£1,000 discount on the Impact Accelerator's regular membership fees if accepted into
					their Cohort 2.
